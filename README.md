TODO:

* Thinking about the IA
* Load sprites with files as with maps
* Fix the horrible map file format, please
* Check for paths in file formats (map
	and sprite), just to have every map into
	one single folder and not repeated in
	every use of it.
* Add GUIs to map editor for creating, saving and loading.
* In map editor, if no args specified, create new map (splash the gui).
* Get a beer.


ACHIEVED:
* 2 ways to make a Map. From zero and from a file
* Command line help and stuff. Two ways to launch the map editor (specify map data by params or specify just one file). Three in the future (add calling the mapeditor without args, splashing to create new map).
